# Rock-Paper-Scissors--AutoPlay
Rock Paper Scissors Auto-play is a web-based implementation of the classic game "Rock Paper Scissors" that introduces an exciting twist with an auto-play feature. This project allows users to engage in the game manually against the computer or sit back and watch as the computer simulates games automatically.
